ansible-backup
=============

[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/tag/lafranceinsoumise/ansible-backup.svg)]()

Ansible role which manage backups. Support file backups, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB and Redis backups.

Redis backup is experimental and only works with [AOF](https://redis.io/topics/persistence) disabled.

Supports export of backup status to Prometheus. Metrics are written in a directory
in order to be exposed by the [Textfile collector](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter#textfile-collector).

Initially forked from [Stouts.backup](https://github.com/Stouts/Stouts.backup).

## Usage

Add `lafranceinsoumise.backup` to your roles and set variables in your playbook file.

Example:

```yaml

- hosts: all

  roles:
    - lafranceinsoumise.backup

  vars:
    backup_target_user: aws_access_key
    backup_target_pass: aws_secret
    backup_profiles:

    # Backup file path
    - name: uploads                               # Required params
        schedule: 0 3 * * *                       # At 3am every day
        source: /usr/lib/project/uploads
        target: s3://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/backup.backet/{{ inventory_hostname }}/uploads

    # Backup postgresql database
    - name: postgresql
        schedule: 0 4 * * *                       # At 4am every day
        source: postgresql://project              # Backup prefixes: postgresql://, mysql://, mongo://, redis://
        target: s3://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/backup.backet/{{ inventory_hostname }}/postgresql
        user: postgres

```

### Manage backups manually
